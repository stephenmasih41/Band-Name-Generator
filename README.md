# ðŸŽ¸ Band Name Generator

Welcome to the **Band Name Generator**, the very first project from my Python Bootcamp journey! ðŸš€

This beginner-level project is designed to get comfortable with basic Python syntax, including:
- `print()` function
- `input()` function
- String concatenation

## ðŸ’¡ Project Description

The Band Name Generator is a fun little program that asks the user two simple questions:
1. The name of the city they grew up in.
2. The name of their pet.

It then combines both answers to create a potential **band name**! ðŸŽ¶

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How to get user input with `input()`
- How to display output using `print()`
- How to concatenate strings
- Basic Python formatting and structure

## ðŸ§ª Example Output

```python
Welcome to the Band Name Generator.
What's the name of the city you grew up in? 
> Toronto
What's your pet's name? 
> Shadow
Your band name could be Toronto Shadow
